This project involves creating a turn-based strategy game, similar to chess, where two players engage on a 5x5 grid. Each player manages a team consisting of three unique characters: Pawn, Hero1, and Hero2, each with specific movement and abilities.

The game is structured with a server-client architecture, using WebSockets to enable real-time communication between players. The user interface is built with React, ensuring an interactive and dynamic web-based gaming experience.
